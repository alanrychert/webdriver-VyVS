# Sauce Demo Webpage Testing with Selenium Webdriver

This project, developed in 2021 using Java and Selenium Webdriver, consists of various tests applied to the Sauce Demo webpage (https://www.saucedemo.com/).

The tests focus on verifying the presence, absence, or changes in various HTML components on the webpage. For example, one of the tests checks the functionality of 
adding an item to the shopping cart. This test ensures that, after clicking the appropriate button, the number of items in the shopping cart is correctly updated to 1.
